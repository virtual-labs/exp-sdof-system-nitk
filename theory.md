When an applied force causes the system to vibrate it is considered as a case of forced vibration. An external excitation is often reduced to one of the following types:

<li>External Harmonic Force

</li>
<li>Base Excitation

where [<img src="./images/sdof8.png" width="125" height="20"/>](./images/sdof8.png)is the motion of the base</li>

<li>Rotating Imbalance

</li>

**Solution of the System**

The solution of the forced vibration system consists of a steady state part and a transient part. The steady state response is independent of the initial conditions. The transient part comes to zero with time and is usually neglected. The steady state response is of the form

For [<img src="./images/sdof5.png" width="115" height="25"/>](./images/sdof5.png) external harmonic excitation the steady state parameters are given by

where [<img src="./images/sdof7.png" width="85" height="40"/>](./images/sdof7.png) is the deflection due to static force F0 and η = ω/ω<sub>n</sub> is the ratio of operating frequency to the natural frequency of the system.
